    Deep Learning and Neural Networks

    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. 
    These networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected 
    nodes. Deep learning has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language 
    processing, and speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly 
    effective for image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers 
    excel at sequential data processing.
