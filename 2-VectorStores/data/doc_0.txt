    Machine Learning Fundamentals

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn 
    and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main 
    types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement 
    learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised 
    learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through 
    interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.
