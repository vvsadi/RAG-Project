    Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. 
    Key tasks in NLP include text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, 
    machine translation, and question answering. Modern NLP heavily relies on transformer 
    architectures like BERT, GPT, and T5. These models use attention mechanisms to understand 
    context and relationships between words in text.
