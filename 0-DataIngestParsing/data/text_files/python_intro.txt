Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code clarity 
and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to many other languages.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and 
functional programming. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, 
from small automation scripts to large-scale enterprise systems.

One of Python’s greatest strengths is its extensive standard library and third-party ecosystem. 
Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are widely used for data analysis, while frameworks like 
Django and Flask are popular for web development. Python is also a leading language in the 
field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, with libraries such as TensorFlow, 
PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

Python is cross-platform and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Its strong community support 
and open-source nature have contributed to its rapid adoption across industries such as finance, 
healthcare, education, and cloud computing.

Because of its ease of learning and powerful capabilities, Python is often recommended as a 
first programming language for beginners, while still being powerful enough for experienced 
developers and researchers.
